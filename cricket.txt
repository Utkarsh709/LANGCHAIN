Upon the emerald stage so wide,
Where dreams and destinies often collide,
A gentle hush, the crowd takes seat,
The symphony of cricket begins its beat.

The willow waits, in silent grace,
For leather’s kiss, its destined chase,
The bowler strides with fiery eyes,
As hope and fear in silence rise.

A burst of speed, the ball takes flight,
It cuts the air with all its might,
The batsman sways, a dancer’s art,
Each stroke a story, each shot a heart.

The fielders crouch like hunters keen,
Scanning the gaps, the verdant green,
One slip of chance, one fleeting call,
Can crown a hero or break them all.

The scoreboard hums, the numbers gleam,
Each run a whisper, each over a dream,
And in the stands, the voices soar,
A thousand throats, one roaring score.

The sun bows low, the shadows creep,
The day grows old, yet eyes don’t sleep,
For cricket’s charm, both fierce and sweet,
Is war and waltz on nimble feet.

Not just a game of bat and ball,
It’s courage rising when spirits fall,
A lesson etched in time’s embrace,
Of grit and glory, and endless chase.

So let the cheers like rivers stream,
For every player, for every team,
In cricket’s world, we all belong,
Bound by the game, by love, by song.
